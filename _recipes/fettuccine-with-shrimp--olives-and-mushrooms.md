---

## Ingredients

- 1 lb. dried fettuccine
- 1 T. finely chopped fresh parsley leaves
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tsp. dried oregano, crumbled
- 1/4 C. olive oil
- 3/4 lb. shrimp (about 20), shelled,
- 1 C. mushrooms, sliced
- de-veined, rinsed, and patted dry
- 1/2 C. sliced pitted brine-cured
- 3/4 C. heavy cream
- black olives
- 3/4 C. coarsely grated
- 1/2 C. bottled clam juice (wine)
- Fontina cheese (or Parmesan)
- 1 T. finely chopped fresh basil leaves
- White pepper to taste

## Preparation

In a kettle of salted boiling water, cook the fettuccine until it is “al dente” (not mushy).  While the fettuccine is cooking, in a large skillet cook the garlic and the oil over moderate heat until it is pale golden.  Stir in the mushrooms and the olives, and cook the mixture, stirring, until almost all the liquid the mushrooms give off is evaporated.  Add the clam juice, basil, parsley, and oregano and simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is reduced by one third.  Add the shrimp.  Simmer the mixture for 1-2 minutes, or until the shrimp are just cooked through.  Stir in the cream, Fontina, white pepper, and salt to taste, stirring until the Fontina is just melted.  In a large serving bowl, toss the shrimp mixture with the fettuccine, drain well.  Serves 4.
