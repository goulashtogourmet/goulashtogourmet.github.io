## Ingredients

- Potatoes, cubed
- Velveeta cheese, diced
- Butter
- Cornstarch
- Milk
- Mustard (French's)

## Preparation

I got this recipe from the chef at "Campbell's", a restaurant on Oakdale Road, when we lived by Old Salem Church.  He used leftover baked potatoes, which is excellent, but you can start with raw potatoes. Cook potatoes in salted water until almost tender, drain.  (If using leftover baked potatoes, skip this step).  Add butter and milk (not quite to cover potatoes).  Simmer for about 5 min.  Add about 1 tsp. to 1 T. cornstarch, depending on how much you make, dissolved in a little water.  Simmer for about 5 min.Add cheese and about 2 tsp. mustard.  Mix until smooth.  Pour into buttered casserole or au gratin dishes.  Dot with butter and bake at 350 degrees until browned on top and bubbly.
