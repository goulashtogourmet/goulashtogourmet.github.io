Cut apples very thin, enough to do 2X the height of the pie pan. Keep apples in water until ready to use. Rinse and drain apples and put in bowl . Add sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and flour and mix.  Pile apple mixture on top of bottom crust in pie pan and top with pads of butter.  Use rolling pin to transfer top crust onto pan.   Use fingers to turn edges over and pinch all around. Cut 1-2 vents in center of top crust. Put tin foil on bottom of oven, place pie on bottom rack and bake at 475 for ½ hour. Then move to top rack and continue baking at 375 for an additional ½ hour until crust is browned.
