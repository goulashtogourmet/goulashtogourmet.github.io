## Preparation

For the crust, stir together crushed wafers and butter.  Press mixture evenly over the bottom, and 1 1/3 inches up the sides of a 9 inch springform pan.  Place the pan in a shallow baking pan. For the filling, in a large mixing bowl beat cream cheese, sugar, the 4 squares of melted chocolate, flour and vanilla until well mixed.  Add eggs all at once, then beat with electric mixer on low just until mixed.  Do not over-beat!  Stir in milk.  Pour filling onto the crust.  Bake in 350 degree oven about 45 minutes or until center appears nearly set when gently shaken.  Cool on wire rack 5-10 minutes.  Loosen sides of cheesecake from pan.  Cool 30 minutes.  Remove sides of the pan.  Cover and chill for 4 to 24 hours.  For the star design (for decoration), drizzle vanilla-flavored pieces onto the top of the cheesecake:  In a small saucepan, melt one square of chocolate and shortening over low heat; drizzle onto cheesecake for decoration.  Chill until the chocolate is set.  NOTES:  Crush Oreos in food processor.  Take cheesecake out of the oven when it is nearly set in the center, loosen around edge of pan after 10 minutes and cool for 30 minutes.
