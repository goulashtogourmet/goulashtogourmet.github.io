- 1/2 C. sugar
- 1/2 C. shortening
- 2 tsp salt

## Preparation

Mix together lukewarm milk, sugar, and salt.  Crumble 2 pkgs yeast into mixture.  Stir until dissolved.  Stir in 2 eggs, shortening and add flour.  Mix half of flour by spoon, rest by hand.  Mix long enough so that dough leaves side of bowl.  Knead about 10 min. until smooth and elastic.   Use very little flour when kneading.  Place in greased bowl.  Cover with damp cloth 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  Punch down and let rise again for 30 min.  Shape into rolls and let double in size.  Bake at 425 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes.
