## Ingredients

- 1 ½ lbs. ground beef, browned
- 2 or 3 pkg. Ramen noodles (use only 1 pkg. seasoning)
- ¼ C. slivered almonds
- 2 pkg. frozen Japanese vegetables
- 1 T butter
- 2 T soy sauce
- 1 can beef broth
- 1 can water

## Preparation

Brown ground beef.  Brown slivered almonds in butter and set aside.  Add beef broth and water to ground beef and bring to a boil.  Add the 2 or 3 packages of Ramen noodles and only 1 pkg. of seasoning.  Simmer 3 minutes and separate noodles.  Add veggies and soy sauce and simmer about 3 minutes.  Add the noodles back, top with almonds.  (This is a good casserole to make ahead and re-heat in microwave.)
