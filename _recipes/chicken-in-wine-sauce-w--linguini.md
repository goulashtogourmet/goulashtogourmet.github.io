## Ingredients

- 1 small pkg linguini
- 1 tsp chicken bouillon paste
- 1 T olive oil
- ¼ cup diced onion
- 1 large pat butter
- 1 tsp minced garlic
- 4 boneless chicken breasts
- ¼ cup white wine
- 1/2 cup flour

## Preparation

Start heating water for the linguini. Pound chicken breasts to about ½” to ¼” thick, taking care to make thickness uniform. In large frying pan, heat olive oil with butter on medium/medium low heat. Dredge breasts in flour and saute in pan, cook through (won’t take long) but don’t brown. Remove to a plate. To the oil and butter in the pan, add bouillon paste, onion, garlic. Add white wine and scrape pan to deglaze brown bits from cooking the chicken. Reduce somewhat. Add chicken breasts back into pan, turn to coat all sides, and turn heat to low. When the pasta is al dente, use tongs to take pasta from water and put directly into pan with chicken and sauce  (do not drain or rinse), toss to coat with sauce, and serve.
