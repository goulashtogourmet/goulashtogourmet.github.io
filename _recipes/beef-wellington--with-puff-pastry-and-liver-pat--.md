Place beef on rack in pan in 425 degree oven for 45 minutes or until meat thermometer reaches 130.

Place meat in center, fold pastry around meat.  Brush with beaten egg to seal.  Then turn onto baking sheet, seam side down, brush with beaten egg.  Make pastry cut-outs with remaining dough and put on top of meat pastry.  Brush again with egg.  This creates a golden brown surface after baking.  Bake 35 minutes in 425 degree oven.  Serve with sauce.Sauce or gravy:  Sauté mushrooms in 4 T butter.  Set aside.  Melt 2 T butter in pan; add flour to make roux.  Add beef consommé, bouillon cube and tomato paste.
