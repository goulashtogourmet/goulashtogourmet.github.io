## Ingredients

- 2-2 ½ lbs country-style ribs
- 2 cups water
- 1 tsp olive oil
- ½ medium onion
- 1 ½ lb package sauerkraut
- salt and pepper
- ½ tsp brown sugar
- 3-4 large potatoes

## Preparation

Pre-heat oven to 325.  Trim excess fat from ribs and cut into small pieces.  In large dutch oven, drizzle olive oil in bottom and place ribs in a single layer and brown on medium heat. Don’t over-cook, just brown them. Turn heat to simmer. Take package of sauerkraut, rinse and wring dry (don’t over-rinse or you will lose all of the flavor.) Add water and sauerkraut to ribs. Chop onion and add to ribs/sauerkraut with a little brown sugar and salt and pepper to taste. Cut potatoes into chunks and add to pot. Cover and cook on simmer (stirring occasionally) for 1 hour. Transfer pot to oven and finish at 325 for another hour, stirring occasionally to keep meat and potatoes covered by the sauce.
