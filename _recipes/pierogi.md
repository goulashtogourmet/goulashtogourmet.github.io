## Ingredients

- FILLING:
- DOUGH:
- 2 qts. Russet potatoes, cooked
- 2 C. flour
- 1/4 lb. onions, diced
- 2 eggs
- 1/2 C. butter
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 lg. pkg. Velveeta cheese
- 1/3 C. water

## Preparation

For filling, mash 2 quarts cooked potatoes.  Dice 1/4 lb. onions and saute in butter.  Cube 1/2 large pkg. Velveeta cheese.  Mix onion and cheese into mashed potatoes.Mound flour on bread board and make a well in the center.  Drop eggs and salt into well.  Add water.  Working from the center to the outside of the flour mound, mix flour into liquid in center with one hand and keep flour mounded with the other hand.  Knead until dough is firm and well-mixed.  Cover dough with a warm bowl and let rest 10 minutes. Divide dough into halves.  On floured surface, using half of dough at a time, roll dough as thin as possible.  Cut out 3 inch rounds with a large biscuit cutter.  Place a small spoonful of filling a little to one side on each round of dough.  Moisten edge with water, fold over and press edges together firmly.  Be sure they are well sealed to prevent the filling from leaking out.  Drop pierogi into boiling salted water.  Boil gently 3 to 5 minutes or until pierogi floats.  Lift out of water with perforated spoon.  Makes 1 1/2 to 2 dozen.  NOTE:  Dough will have a tendency to dry.  A dry dough will not seal completely.  Work with half the dough at a time, rolling out a large circle of dough and placing small mounds of filling far enough apart to allow for cutting.  Then cut with biscuit cutter and seal firmly.  Never put too many pierogi in cooking water.  The uncooked will stick together and the cooked will get lumpy and tough.  Dough can be mixed in a bread machine or mixer.  Increase flour to 2 Â½ C. and water to 1 C. and reduce eggs to 1 and salt to a pinch.A substitute for making the dough by hand is the use of wonton wrappers.  Place a tsp. of filling in the center of the wonton wrap.  With your finger, moisten two sides with water, fold into a triangle shape and seal. If you want them to appear the same as hand-made, you can use kitchen shears to trim the wrapper into a rounded shape. Boil as noted above.
