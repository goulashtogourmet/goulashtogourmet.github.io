When fish is done, carefully drain poaching liquid into flour mixture and whisk to blend.  Set fish aside, covered.Microwave sauce at high 2 to 3 minutes, whisking every minute, until thickened.  Blend in lemon juice.  Pour sauce over fish, then sprinkle with cheese.  Microwave on high 2 more minutes until cheese has melted.  Sprinkle with parsley.  Serves 4.
