## Ingredients

- 1 lg. navel orange, peeled
- 2 T. chopped shallots
- 4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
- 1/3 C. Port
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1/2 C. heavy cream
- 1/4 tsp. pepper
- 2 T. Dijon-style mustard
- 2 T. butter
- 2 T. minced fresh chives
- 1 T. oil

## Preparation

Dice orange.  Pound chicken between 2 wax paper sheets to ¼ in. thickness.  Season with salt and pepper.  In large skillet, melt butter in oil until it foams.  Sauté chicken about 3 minutes each side (golden outside, white inside).  Put on platter and cover to keep warm.  Pour off all but 1 T. fat.  Add shallots until softened, but not brown.  After about 1 minute, add Port and orange.  Bring to a boil, scraping up browned bits.  Add cream and mustard.  Cook over high heat until thickened, about 3 minutes.  Pour sauce over chicken and sprinkle with chives.
