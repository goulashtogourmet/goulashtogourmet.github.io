## Ingredients

- 3 large eggs
- 1 tsp. vanilla
- 2 C. granulated sugar
- 1 C. coarsely chopped nuts
- 3/4 C. vegetable oil
- 3 apples (about 1 1/2 lbs.)
- 2 C. flour
- Confectionerâ€™s sugar (to dust)
- 2 tsp. cinnamon
- 1 tsp. baking soda

## Preparation

In a large bowl, with an electric mixer, beat the eggs until they are light and fluffy.  In a small bowl, stir together the granulated sugar and oil and beat the sugar mixture into the eggs until the mixture is combined well.  In another bowl, whisk together the flour, cinnamon, and baking soda and add the mixture to the egg mixture, beating.  Beat in the vanilla and nuts and beat the batter until it is just combined.  Arrange the apples, peeled and sliced thin, in the bottom of a greased 9 x 13 baking dish.  Spread the batter evenly over the apples and bake the cake in the middle of a preheated oven at 350 degrees for 50 to 60 minutes, or until tester comes out clean.  Let the cake cool in the baking dish on a rack for 15 minutes and dust it with confectioners' sugar.
